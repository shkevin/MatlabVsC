# MatlabVsC

This code represents research into Matlab's matrix multiplication being compared against C. The paper describes more of the analyses and hypothesis. This project was used to help understand non-parametric analyses, benchmarking, as well as overleaf.

# Installation

Simply download/pull the code.

# Usage

Several of the functions used in the matlab analysis can be called in matlab.

The benchmarking done in C can be called as:

```C
make all
./"Desired file"
```
